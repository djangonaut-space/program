# Djangonaut Program

This program places an emphasis on group-learning, sustainability and longevity. 
Djangonauts are members of the community who wish to level up their current Django 
code contributions and potentially take on leadership roles in Django in the 
future. :unicorn:

This is a group mentoring program where individuals will work self-paced in a 
semi-structured learning environment over the course of three months.

Want to be involved in the future direction of Django? Confidently vote on proposals? 
This could be a great way to launch your Django contribution career! :rocket:

## How this works

### Cohorts

- No more than 4 Djangonauts per 1 Navigator[^1] and no more than 8 total Djangonauts in 
  a group.
- Every Djangonaut has the same goal and is at a relatively similar level.
- Programs last three months.
- Each cohort has access to a private Discord server[^2].
- Programs receive support from Captains.

Each week there are stand ups facilitated by the Navigators with the expectation that 
cohort members check-in with a form of status update, ask questions and receives feedback. 
Navigators can rotate in attending these.

Captains help organise the program and reduce the admin burden for Navigators. They are 
community managers who help orchastrate the warm, welcoming environment at Django we all
know and love. :heart:
  
[^1]: Having multiple Djangonauts per Navigator scales better than a 1:1 mentorship 
  relationship. This has an added benefit that peers can help each other in a community 
  setting.
[^2]: It can be intimidating to post questions and ask for help in very public settings. 
  The program will aim to uplift Djangonauts to be comfortable with this by the end of the 
  program, but aims to create a welcoming, inclusive, and safe space for those that need a 
  little more encouragement.

### Benefits of a Cohort

- Peer mentoring.
- Clear goals, objectives, and timelines.
- All Djangonauts are working towards the same goal.
- Navigators share time commitments and responsibilities.
- Exposure to multiple mentorship relationships in an open and collaborative environment.


## Program Goals

- Increase sustainable and regular contributions and community involvement with Django.
- Provide an actively accessible and inclusive space for the development of Djangonauts.
- Improve sustainability of Django's development through empowering others to progress 
  into Django leadership roles.
