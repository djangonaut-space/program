## Welcome and Summary

Welcome prospective Djangonaut! 
This is an 8-week group mentoring program where individuals will work self-paced in a 
semi-structured learning environment.

Want to be involved in the future direction of Django? Confidently vote on proposals? 
This could be a great way to launch your Django contribution career! :rocket:

During the 8-week period, you will work to level up your Django contributions 
along with peers who have the same goal. This cohort will include Navigators who have 
specialised knowledge and experience. Think of them as pilots guiding you through the 
Django universe. :stars:

At the end of the 8-week period, you will have a number of contributions credited 
to your name, be integrated into the Django contributor community, and have an 
understanding as to what comes next! :muscle:

**Important Note** 

This program will have a focus on sustainability and longevity throughout. 
Remember that, while we want you to be successful, your health and happiness comes 
above all else. :heart:

## Expectations

- Good standing throughout the program and uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Attendance during weekly stand-up meetings between Djangonauts and Navigators. 
  Here you will receive feedback and support.
- Be helpful to your peers in the program.
- Mutual respect to fellow Djangonauts, Navigators and all who you interact with 
  throughout the program.
  

## Benefits of the Program

There are many benefits to being active in the Django open source community. We will 
discuss a few of these below.

### Upskilling

Contributing to Django will have you work with some incredibly talented and 
knowledgeable members of the community. 

You will learn to work at a level which may be completely different to what is 
required from you in other settings. Whether this is having to consider the 
differences between multiple databases, that `.join()` is faster for a `list` object 
than a `generator` object, or how to rebase your commits for a coherent commit 
history - you are guaranteed to learn while also bringing your unique skills and 
experience to the table.

### Finding your dream job

Open source contributions can help you stand out from the crowd when looking for 
your next role. Having this experience on your CV can get you interviews and help 
you skip steps in a hiring process! You will also build a network of people who have 
seen how you work and can recommend you for a role.

This is particularly useful for anyone early in their career, those looking for a 
role change, or when the job market is particularly competitive.

### Visibility

Open source contributions get you noticed. They give you a level of credibility and 
confidence which you can use as rocket fuel for your career.

Are you in awe when someone says they actively contribute to Django? Lots of people 
are! 

You can use this for:

- Joining Django's Steering Committee / technical leadership.
- The subject of a conference talk.
- Promoting your blog and/or books!
- Invitations to podcasts.
- Part of your journey into the PSF and Python contributions.

Those are just a few ideas! Once you have launched, there is no telling where this 
journey could take you.


**Important Note**

Time investment in anything without receiving a paycheck is difficult to justify. 
Your time is valuable, and we respect that monetary concerns may limit or prevent 
your ability to participate in this program. In the future we would love to accept 
applications to have certain participants sponsored to partake in this program. 

If this is the case for you, please reach out to the team, so we can contact you in 
the future if we have budget to support:
