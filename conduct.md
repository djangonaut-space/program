# Code of Conduct

Djangonaut Space is a place where we look to facilitate the growth of
some of the future contributors to the Django community. To that end
we are dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone,
regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion,
or nationality.

Our code of conduct is based on [Django's Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/).
This code of conduct applies to
all areas involved with Djangonaut Space. This includes Discord, email,
video conferences, and any channels community uses for communication.
In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a
person's ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you
report it by emailing conduct@djangonaut.space.

- **Be friendly and patient.**

- **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
  people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not
  limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin,
  colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational
  level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age,
  size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and
  physical ability.

- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect
  users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into
  account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide
  community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary
  language.

- **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement
  is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience
  some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to
  turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community
  where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
  Members of the Djangonaut Space community should be respectful when dealing
  with other members as well as with people outside the community.

- **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of professionals,
  and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult
  or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior
  aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  -  Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  -  Discriminatory jokes and language.
  -  Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  -  Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  -  Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  -  Unwelcome sexual attention.
  -  Repeated or inappropriate direct messaging on any communication platform.
  -  Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  -  Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

- **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time and Django is no exception. It is important
  that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember
  that we’re different. Different people have different perspectives on issues.
  Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean
  that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each
  other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues
  and learning from mistakes.


## Reporting a code of conduct violation

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it
to the Djangonaut Space organizers by emailing conduct@djangonaut.space. All
reports will be kept confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public
statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims
and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement
first.** If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate,
please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

### What to include in your report

In your report please include:
- Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
- When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
- Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record please include a link.
- Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
- If you believe this incident is ongoing.
- Any other information you believe we should have.

### What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from the Djangonaut Space organizers acknowledging
receipt as quickly as we can.

The organizers will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:

- What happened.
- Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
- Who the bad actor was.
- Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the
organizers' immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we
may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and
that everyone is physically safe.

Once the organizers have a complete account of the events they will make a
decision as to how to response. Responses may include:

- Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
- A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.
- A public reprimand.
- A permanent or temporary ban from Djangonaut Space's platforms and/or the
  program itself.
- A request for a public or private apology.
- An escalation to the Django Code of Conduct Working Group for action
  within the broader Django community.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with
either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original
reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll
take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of
our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.

### What if your report concerns a possible violation by an organizer?

If you feel uncomfortable filing a report with the Djangonaut Space organizers
we recommend that you file a report with Django's Code of Conduct Working Group.
