## Captain Guidelines

A sustainable program requires a crew of people ensuring its success. Clearly defined 
roles which share responsibilities across a group help us to mitigate against the risk 
of burnout. While we want the program to be successful, we want everyone to be happy 
and healthy above all else, and our Captains our critical to this.

Captains are community managers who coordinate the program, advise Navigators, and 
engage in periodic 1:1 sessions with Djangonauts. They keep the ship on course. :boat:


## Responsibilities and Expectations

In this 3 month program, you will support Djangonauts and Navigators to have a successful 
experience.

- Your goal is to embody the inclusive warm community that we have at Django. This
  may include celebrating successes or sharing personal stories (humanising yourself and 
  others).

- Manage onboarding for Djangonauts with the program. Help set expectations and get them
  up to speed. 
  
- On Discord 1-2 hours a week to help connect others.

- Set up 1:1 and attend sessions with Djangonauts every 2 weeks to offer support. 
  This is optional for the Djangonauts, they do not have to use these.
  
- Attend the program welcome and closing sessions.

- Coordinate with program Navigators. Share feedback from your personal 1:1s with 
  Djangonauts and help with the running of the program.
  
- Make introductions to resources and people for the Djangonaut - this is sponsorship 
  which is equally important as mentorship.

- Help to build relationships amongst the group - this can be as simple as initiating 
  conversations and sharing in Discord.

As a rough guide, being a Captain should be a 3-5 hour per week commitment for 3 months. 
Later in the program the time commitments may reduce as the Djangonauts should become
more independent. There may also be a drop off in the number of Djangonauts which would
also reduce a Captain's time commitments.

We have a fantastic community, and we appreciate the time you dedicate to ensuring 
its future! :heart:
