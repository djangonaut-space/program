# Financial Aid Guidelines

This document outlines Djangonaut Space’s selection process and award amount process for financial aid recipients.

This is meant to be able to be shared publicly, so this should not contain sensitive information.

## Guiding Principles
Our guiding principles for the financial aid awards are as follows:
- Connect budding community members with the community
- Provide a platform for recipient to advance their career
- Recruit future Djangonauts and Navigators

## Selection process
People can apply for financial aid at any time. This makes it a challenge to select recipients because there’s a finite amount of money to be awarded and there can be several qualified conferences and candidates.

### Qualified candidates
An applicant must do the following:
- Be an active member(see below) of Djangonaut Space
- Explain how the event will benefit them

An active member is someone who fits one of the criteria:
- Was a Djangonaut who attended at least three Navigator meetings during a session within the last six months
- A Star who has done any of the following:
- Attended a Djangonaut Space community event in the last month
- Had at least three messages on the server within the last three months
- A Navigator who held at least four meetings in a session in the last six months
- A Captain who met with their Djangonauts at least half the time in a session in the last six months
- A Session Organizer who attended at least half the Session Organizer meetings in the last 12 months

### Qualified conferences/events
The conference or event the application is being submitted for must be the following:
- Django or Python related, or an event local to the applicant
- Be publicly visible so it can be verified
- Align with Djangonaut Space’s Code of Conduct and spirit
- Expenses can only be used for conference tickets, lodging and travel

### Other qualified request reasons
An applicant can request equipment, software or tools that would significantly improve their ability to do any of the following:
- Participate in Djangonaut Space
- Participate in the Django community
- Contribute to open source

An example of this type of request may be a quality microphone so they can communicate more effortlessly.

### Application ranking
In the likely case multiple applications are submitted, the applications must be compared to each other. The following criteria should be used to identify which applications should be prioritized. To be clear, the following criteria are for ranking. They should not be used to reject an application. These are in order of importance from greatest to least.

1. First-time conference attendees
2. First-time conference speakers
3. Current Djangonauts
4. Presenting on Djangonaut Space
5. Level of participation in Djangonaut Space and/or Django community
6. Has not requested financial aid from Djangonaut Space before

## Award amount process
To help make awarding financial aid easier for multiple applications for a variety of events throughout the year, the following constraints must be followed:

- A limit of $300 per person, per event
- A limit of $600 per person, per year
    - One of the events must be attended in service of Djangonaut Space
- A limit of $150 per person for equipment, for five years
- A limit of $900 total financial awards per event
A limit of $2400 in total financial awards per year
