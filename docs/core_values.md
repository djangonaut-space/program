# Djangonaut Space Core Values

Our values define who we are and guide how we nurture the next generation of Django contributors.

### 🤝 Community & Belonging    
We rise together. Our strength comes from collective learning, peer support, and genuine connections. We actively welcome people of all backgrounds, identities, and experience levels. Inclusion is woven into everything we do. We celebrate successes both big and small, share stories, and remember that behind every commit is a person deserving of recognition and respect.     

### 🌱 Sustainable Growth
Health and happiness over speed. We believe in steady, sustainable progress that enriches lives rather than drains them. We embrace mistakes as learning opportunities and value both those who move fast and those who move slow, as long as they keep coming back. Contributing to open source should be fulfilling and fun, not a source of burnout.

### 🚀 Empowerment Through Access
Remove barriers, create pathways. We guide without gatekeeping, sharing knowledge, resources, and connections generously. We recognize that time and resources aren't equally available to everyone, so we work to provide financial support and ensure opportunities reach those who need them most. The organization creates the pathways, our volunteers help guide members to grow into Django leadership roles.

### 💫 Excellence with Empathy
Professional, patient, kind. We conduct ourselves with respect, choosing words carefully and assuming good intentions. We operate with transparency, communicate clear expectations, and handle conflicts with care and confidentiality. No one has all the answers; we value curiosity, encourage questions, and believe everyone is continuously learning.

### 🚀 Space Puns
We build connections beyond code. This means we love and encourage sharing photos and discussions of pets, hobbies, and travels. And we will always go for a space pun and an extra emoji where possible! 🌌  What might seem silly to some, we’ve found very helpful in helping our global distributed community connect and relate to each other as people, because as we all know we “Came for the code, but stayed for the community”.

*These values are our commitment: to each other, to our Djangonauts, and to everyone who joins our journey through the Django universe.*
