# I want to participate, where do I start?

So you know what [we are about](README.md), you have read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and you are interested in getting started, so what now?

Because we are an inclusive community with a large range of skill levels we want to make sure we all have some understanding of a few points: Django, Python, Open Source Contributing, and Git. You aren't expected to be an expert in any of these but some knowledge will definitely help get you started. Please read the through the questions below to find a question that you can relate with to help you find your starting point. 


**What is Django/Python?**
- If you haven't yet, you probably want to start with going over the [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) to get familiar with Django, Python, and Git. If you have some experience in one but not all of these, maybe skim through the parts you are familiar with. 

**What is Git/GitHub?**
- If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) might be helpful.  

**What is Open Source Contributing?**
- GitHub has created a great [Contributing Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) to go over what it's about, the process, and best practices. We'd encourage you to read it over.
- Django also has a [contributing tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/). Going through this will make sure you're set up to tackle tickets.

**What are the expectations of participants?**
- Have good standing throughout the program and uphold the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Attend weekly meetings to receive feedback and support.
- A commitment of 4 hours a week over the course of 8-weeks.
- For more details about being a participant, please read our [Djangonaut Guidelines](djangonauts.md).
