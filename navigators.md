## Navigator Guidelines

After over 15 years since it was first released, the Django framework has become vast 
and no one has all the answers. So it's not surprising that many find contributing to 
Django to be intimidating.

Our contributors rely on our docs, commenting on tickets, and interacting with others 
to get up to speed. Whether it's using the Django Forum, Discord, mailing list, or 
DjangoCons, contributors want to discuss the technical specifics, the landscape, or how 
to best to add value.

By being a Navigator you engage in this conversation and can help accelerate someone's 
path to being integrated and productive within Django. :rocket:

This program is designed to take everyone's time into consideration. We know it is 
difficult to carve out steady time to support someone. When you're a Navigator in this 
program, the communication framework has been set up for you so your expectations are 
set for when you are ready to dig into mentoring.

You are serving two roles - coach and advisor. You are a problem solver that doesn't 
have all the answers but will know the best resources to go to get the guidance that is 
needed. You are helping to create a culture of continuous improvement, collaboration and 
feedback. As well as ensuring all Djangonauts feel included and welcome. :heart:

### Myths

- You have to know everything about Django - or even about your area of expertise.
- You have to spend a lot of time with your allocated Djangonauts.
- Only new contributors need mentoring.


## Responsibilities and Expectations

In this 3 month program, Djangonauts will be asked to take responsibility for their 
growth and improvement, as it's a semi-structured self-paced program; however, you are 
there to help guide them by sharing your methodologies, resources, tips and experience.

- Your goal is to be a guide and not a teacher. If you have the time to teach someone the 
  fundamentals in git, please do, but know that isn't required. In this scenario, you 
  should be able to help identify resources for learning git for the Djangonaut.

- Ticket grooming. For example, picking tickets which don't require greater buy-in from 
  the community (e.g. accepted bug tickets), or choosing these tickets because they are 
  learning how to propose a direction and facilitate a community vote. By assigning or 
  cc-ing Djangonauts to these tickets, they will know what to draw their attention to.
  
- On Discord 1-2 hours a week fielding questions.

- Attendance of a weekly 1-hour stand-up between Djangonauts and Navigators. You can 
  share attendance responsibilities with your fellow Navigators - only one Navigator is 
  required.
  
- Attend the program welcome and closing sessions.

- Coordinate with program Captains. They will share feedback from their personal 1:1s 
  with Djangonauts and help with the running of the program.
  
- Make introductions to resources and people for the Djangonaut - this is sponsorship 
  which is equally important as mentorship.
  
- Help the Djangonaut to be productive.

- Help to build relationships amongst the group - this can be as simple as initiating 
  conversations and sharing in Discord.

- Practice patience and empathy. Through repetition, people learn, we cannot expect a 
  Djangonaut to meet all expectations. Through the removal of rigid expectations and 
  bias, and with a sprinkle of compassion, we can better support our Djangonauts.

- Have some fun and learn together!

As a rough guide, being a Navigator should be a 2-4 hour per week commitment for 3 months. 
Later in the program the time commitments may reduce as the Djangonauts should become
more independent. There may also be a drop off in the number of Djangonauts which would
also reduce a Navigator's time commitments.


## Benefits of being a Navigator

- Personally ensure the sustainability and longevity of Django. Help the growth of a 
  Django contributor and reduce the risk of burnout.
  
- Grow as a leader in the community, improve your communication skills.

- Gain perspective. Learn where we have holes in our processes and documentation first 
  hand.
  

We have a fantastic community, and we appreciate the time you dedicate to ensuring 
its future! :heart:
